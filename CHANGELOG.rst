Changelog
=========

Unreleased
----------

* Fixed the ``discomfort_index`` docstring example. At 30 °C and 60 % RH the
  index is 26.6 ("More than 50% feels discomfort"), not 27.3 ("Most of the
  population feels discomfort").
* Fixed ``work_capacity_hothaps`` and ``work_capacity_dunne`` rejecting a
  ``WorkIntensity`` member (e.g. ``WorkIntensity.MODERATE``) as ``work_intensity`` with
  "must be one of", while the same value as a string worked
  (`#470 <https://github.com/pythermalcomfort/pythermalcomfort/issues/470>`_).
* Internal calls between package functions now pass arguments by keyword, so two
  same-typed arguments (e.g. ``tdb`` and ``tr``) cannot be swapped silently. A new test
  checks every call in the package for this. The ``pmv_e`` and ``ankle_draft``
  docstring examples now use keyword arguments. Public function signatures and results
  are unchanged
  (`#441 <https://github.com/pythermalcomfort/pythermalcomfort/issues/441>`_).
* Fixed the ``heat_index_lu`` docstring example, which showed 25.9 instead of the 25.0
  the call returns, and updated the Lu and Romps reference to the published 2022 paper
  (`#257 <https://github.com/pythermalcomfort/pythermalcomfort/issues/257>`_).
* Fixed ``JOS3`` initialization for low metabolic rates by allowing its internal
  neutral-temperature search outside ISO 7730's comfort applicability limits. This
  prevents discontinuous or NaN core and skin set points and resulting NaN simulations.
  Previously affected set points change; the public ``pmv_ppd_iso()`` applicability
  limits remain unchanged
  (`#435 <https://github.com/pythermalcomfort/pythermalcomfort/issues/435>`_).
* Fixed the ``solar_gain`` docstring example, which showed ``erf`` 42.9 and
  ``delta_mrt`` 10.3 instead of the 43.3 and 10.4 the call returns
  (`#449 <https://github.com/pythermalcomfort/pythermalcomfort/issues/449>`_).
* Sped up ``sports_heat_stress_risk`` by roughly 3-9x (depending on the sport's
  duration) (`#396 <https://github.com/pythermalcomfort/pythermalcomfort/issues/396>`_).
  The ``brentq`` threshold solvers now call the PHS scalar kernel directly instead of
  the public ``phs()``, skipping its input validation and the ``numba`` parallel array
  dispatch on every solver iteration. Results are unchanged.

4.6.1 (2026-10-06)
------------------

* Fixed ``AdaptivePlot.plot()``'s default x-axis label to use the terminology of
  the active standard: ``Prevailing Mean Outdoor Air Temperature [°C]`` for
  ASHRAE 55 (previously missing "Air") and ``Running Mean Outdoor Temperature
  [°C]`` for EN 16798 (previously used the ASHRAE wording) (#418).
* Fixed ``vertical_tmp_grad_ppd`` returning negative ``ppd_vg`` values for small
  gradients or warm thermal sensation; the result is now set to 0 when the
  logistic model is below the 34.5 % baseline (Liu et al. 2020, eq. 3).
* Fixed ``AdaptivePlot`` losing or mislabeling legend entries for comfort bands and
  the center line when the legend is rebuilt after adding measured data (#415).
* ``PsychrometricPlot`` draws constant-RH background curves at 25 % intervals
  instead of 10 %, and RH labels use Matplotlib's default font size instead of a
  fixed 8 pt, for readability on charts of different sizes.
* Fixed ``AdaptivePlot.plot()`` showing Matplotlib's internal auto-generated
  label (e.g. ``_child0``) in the legend when ``fill_kws`` or
  ``center_line_kws`` explicitly passed ``label=None``, instead of falling
  back to the band's or center line's configured default label.

4.6.0 (2026-09-17)
------------------

* Standardized the default plot palette: cooler regions progress from pale to muted
  blue, warmer regions from pale to muted terracotta, and a true central comfort
  region uses neutral gray. Out-of-model-limit areas use a contrasting neutral gray,
  and plots limit each axis to six major tick labels by default.
* Added an annual PMV heatmap-and-summary Matplotlib recipe to the plotting examples.
* Deprecated the following legacy public import paths. They continue to work for two
  minor releases and emit ``DeprecationWarning`` pointing to their new locations;
  this is not an immediate breaking change.

  * Environment calculations:

    * ``pythermalcomfort.utilities.mean_radiant_tmp`` →
      ``pythermalcomfort.environment.mean_radiant_tmp``
    * ``pythermalcomfort.utilities.operative_tmp`` →
      ``pythermalcomfort.environment.operative_tmp``
    * ``pythermalcomfort.utilities.running_mean_outdoor_temperature`` →
      ``pythermalcomfort.environment.running_mean_outdoor_temperature``
    * ``pythermalcomfort.utilities.transpose_sharp_altitude`` →

    * ``pythermalcomfort.utils.scale_wind_speed_log`` →
      ``pythermalcomfort.environment.scale_wind_speed_log``

  * Psychrometric calculations:

    * ``pythermalcomfort.utilities.p_sat`` →
      ``pythermalcomfort.psychrometrics.p_sat``
    * ``pythermalcomfort.utilities.p_sat_torr`` →
      ``pythermalcomfort.psychrometrics.p_sat_torr``
    * ``pythermalcomfort.utilities.antoine`` →
      ``pythermalcomfort.psychrometrics.antoine``
    * ``pythermalcomfort.utilities.psy_ta_rh`` →
      ``pythermalcomfort.psychrometrics.psy_ta_rh``
    * ``pythermalcomfort.utilities.hr_to_rh`` →
      ``pythermalcomfort.psychrometrics.hr_to_rh``
    * ``pythermalcomfort.utilities.wet_bulb_tmp`` →
      ``pythermalcomfort.psychrometrics.wet_bulb_tmp``
    * ``pythermalcomfort.utilities.dew_point_tmp`` →
      ``pythermalcomfort.psychrometrics.dew_point_tmp``
    * ``pythermalcomfort.utilities.enthalpy_air`` →
      ``pythermalcomfort.psychrometrics.enthalpy_air``

  * Clothing calculations:

    * ``pythermalcomfort.utilities.clo_dynamic_ashrae`` →
      ``pythermalcomfort.clothing.clo_dynamic_ashrae``
    * ``pythermalcomfort.utilities.clo_dynamic_iso`` →
      ``pythermalcomfort.clothing.clo_dynamic_iso``
    * ``pythermalcomfort.utilities.clo_intrinsic_insulation_ensemble`` →
      ``pythermalcomfort.clothing.clo_intrinsic_insulation_ensemble``
    * ``pythermalcomfort.utilities.clo_area_factor`` →
      ``pythermalcomfort.clothing.clo_area_factor``
    * ``pythermalcomfort.utilities.clo_insulation_air_layer`` →
      ``pythermalcomfort.clothing.clo_insulation_air_layer``
    * ``pythermalcomfort.utilities.clo_total_insulation`` →
      ``pythermalcomfort.clothing.clo_total_insulation``
    * ``pythermalcomfort.utilities.clo_correction_factor_environment`` →
      ``pythermalcomfort.clothing.clo_correction_factor_environment``

* Moved internal-only ``valid_range`` and ``mapping`` from
  ``pythermalcomfort.shared_functions`` to
  ``pythermalcomfort._internal.validation`` as ``_valid_range`` and ``_mapping``.
  These private helpers were never public API, so no compatibility aliases are
  provided.
* Fixed ``validate_type`` so NumPy scalar inputs are returned as native Python
  scalars, and updated input dataclasses to store those normalized values.
* **Breaking (plots only):** ``ThresholdPlot`` (and therefore
  ``PsychrometricPlot``) now finds region boundaries by root-finding instead of
  contouring a raster grid. For every row of the plot it bisects to the exact
  place where the output crosses a threshold, and where the model leaves its
  applicability limits, then fills between the resulting curves. Region edges
  and the out-of-model-limits area follow smooth curves rather than grid steps.
  Where a boundary lies no longer depends on ``resolution`` at all; sampling
  only decides whether a feature is *found*, so a model that turns sharply
  enough to hide a crossing between two samples still needs a finer setting.
  Charts where
  several limits clip each other -- ``pmv_ppd_iso``, whose PMV, dry-bulb and
  vapour-pressure limits used to leave a staircase of grey squares -- benefit
  most.

  A threshold may be crossed more than once along a row, and each crossing gets
  its own curve. ``ppd`` is the usual case: it falls to a minimum at neutrality
  and rises again, so "PPD below 10" is a strip with "above 10" on both sides.
  Such a chart used to be drawn on the raster path and came out jagged; it is
  now solved like any other.

  The boundaries come back as coordinate arrays in ``result.boundaries``, one
  ``BoundaryCurve`` per threshold per branch, with ``.threshold``, ``.branch``,
  ``.x`` and ``.y``, so they can be re-used, exported or re-styled directly.

  **The contour backend is gone**, along with ``plot()``'s ``backend`` argument
  and ``result.backend``. Geometry that cannot be laid out the same way in
  every row -- an internal hole in the model's valid area, or a pair of
  crossings that only appears partway up the chart -- now raises ``ValueError``
  rather than silently falling back to a grid-stepped rendering. Narrowing the
  axis ranges to where the model is well behaved is usually the fix;
  ``utci()``, for instance, needs ``tdb`` capped near 42 degC before its
  polynomial stops diverging (see #410).

  ``result.fills`` is consequently a list of one ``fill_between`` polygon per
  band rather than a single ``ContourSet``, and ``fill_kws`` reaches
  ``ax.fill_between`` rather than ``ax.contourf``. Code testing
  ``isinstance(artist, QuadContourSet)`` no longer matches.

* ``resolution`` is now optional on ``set_x_axis`` and ``set_y_axis``. It never
  set the precision of a boundary -- bisection does -- so it only matters for a
  model that turns sharply enough to step over a feature between samples. Both
  axes have sampling floors, so omitting it gives a chart that is already
  smooth.

* Threshold boundary lines are now hidden by default (``show_lines=True``
  brings them back): the region fills meet exactly on the boundary, so the
  colour change already marks it and the extra line mostly added weight. The
  out-of-model-limits shading is a light neutral gray (``#C4C9CC``).
  The grid and the top and right spines are now set on the axis rather than
  through ``rc_context``, which fixes charts drawn on a caller-supplied ``ax``
  keeping whatever frame and grid the caller's ``rcParams`` gave them --
  multi-panel figures were previously styled inconsistently. Call
  ``result.ax.grid(True)`` to put the grid back.

* Threshold and psychrometric charts evaluate their model with
  ``round_output=False``. Models round for display -- ``pmv_ppd_iso`` to 0.01
  PMV -- which turns the output into a staircase, and bisecting
  ``output >= threshold`` on a staircase parks the boundary on the edge of a
  quantisation plateau instead of the real crossing: about 0.03 degC of
  dry-bulb at a typical PMV slope. Setting ``round_output`` through
  ``set_params`` still overrides this.

* Threshold and psychrometric charts no longer relay the models'
  out-of-applicability-limits warnings. Sweeping across those limits is how the
  chart finds the out-of-model-limits area, so the warning fired on every grid
  evaluation and said nothing the chart was not about to shade -- one
  129-point sweep of ``pmv_ppd_iso`` raises two warnings of about 500
  characters each, and a notebook full of charts drowned in them. Calling a
  model directly still warns exactly as before, and only that one message is
  filtered -- warnings reporting a calculation going wrong, such as
  ``cooling_effect``'s solver returning zero, still reach the caller.

* A chart title now sits above however many rows its legend needs, instead of
  at a fixed height: a five-region chart wrapped its legend onto two rows and
  the title landed in the middle of it. The fixed height was marginally too low
  even for a one-row legend, so titles were always very slightly clipped.

* ``PsychrometricPlot`` writes each constant-RH label on its curve, rotated to
  follow it and set in a gap left in the curve, rather than parking it at the
  curve's end. The curves fan out, and a label beside the bundle is easy to
  read against the wrong line.

* Fixed ``heat_index_rothfusz`` and ``heat_index_schoen`` classifying heat stress
  from the rounded heat index. Categories now use the unrounded SI value, so
  ``round_output`` only affects the returned numeric heat index (#381).
* Sped up ``two_nodes_gagge_ji`` by compiling its per-simulation time loop with
  Numba and parallelizing independent array inputs.

4.5.0 (2026-09-15)
------------------

* **Breaking (plots only):** ``PsychrometricPlot``'s y-axis is now expressed in
  **g of water per kg of dry air** instead of kg/kg. Typical indoor humidity
  ratios are 5-20 g/kg, which is far easier to read than 0.005-0.020 kg/kg.
  Pass ``.set_y_axis("hr", 0.0, 30.0, resolution=1.0)`` where you previously
  passed ``.set_y_axis("hr", 0.0, 0.030, resolution=0.001)``. A y-axis whose
  upper bound is below 1 g/kg now emits a ``UserWarning`` explaining the
  change, so an un-migrated call is flagged rather than silently rendering a
  blank chart. It warns rather than raises because humidity ratios below
  1 g/kg are physically real in cold or very dry air (at -20 degC, 0.5 g/kg is
  roughly 80 % RH), which this package supports
  (`#338 <https://github.com/pythermalcomfort/pythermalcomfort/issues/338>`_).

  This does **not** change the psychrometric utilities. ``psy_ta_rh(...).hr``
  still *returns* kg/kg dry air, and ``hr_to_rh()`` and ``enthalpy_air()``
  still *accept* it, which is the SI convention and matches ASHRAE
  Fundamentals. So multiply by 1000 when plotting ``psy_ta_rh(...).hr`` on
  this chart, and divide by 1000 when passing a value read off this chart to
  ``hr_to_rh()`` or ``enthalpy_air()``.
* ``PsychrometricPlot`` now labels its own y-axis. Previously it inherited
  ``ThresholdPlot``'s behaviour of labelling the axis with the raw parameter
  name, so the axis read ``hr`` unless the caller set a label. Every caller
  therefore wrote its own and they disagreed with each other about the units.
  Override with ``result.ax.set_ylabel(...)`` if needed.
* Fixed ``two_nodes_gagge_sleep`` silently truncating or coercing a non-integer
  ``ltime`` keyword argument (e.g. ``1.5`` became one iteration, ``"1"`` was
  accepted as a string) instead of raising. Non-``int`` values now raise
  ``TypeError``, and values below 1 now raise ``ValueError`` rather than
  running zero iterations.
* Fixed invalid Numba annotations on the vectorised helpers in
  ``heat_index_lu``, ``heat_index_rothfusz``, ``heat_index_schoen``, and
  ``utci``. The scalar kernels keep ordinary ``float`` annotations and the
  ``vectorize`` decorators are now typed to reflect that they accept both
  scalars and arrays. The explicit Numba signatures are unchanged, so results
  are unaffected
  (`#393 <https://github.com/pythermalcomfort/pythermalcomfort/issues/393>`_).
* Documentation: clarified the ``pmv_ppd_iso`` model parameters, distinguished
  the ASHRAE and EN acceptability outputs of the adaptive models, and
  documented the air-speed assumptions behind ``AdaptivePlot`` scatter
  overlays.

4.4.3 (2026-09-14)
------------------

* Fixed ``JOS3.dict_results()`` returning body part names instead of simulated
  values (`#264 <https://github.com/pythermalcomfort/pythermalcomfort/issues/264>`_).
  Each per-segment column was built by zipping its keys against a ``JOS3BodyParts``
  ``__dict__``; iterating a dict yields its keys, so roughly 570 of the 577 columns
  held strings such as ``"head"`` rather than temperatures. Only the aggregate
  scalars (``t_skin_mean`` and similar) were correct. ``JOS3.to_csv()`` is affected
  too, since it is built on ``dict_results()``.
* Fixed per-segment values for variables defined on only part of the body
  (``t_muscle``, ``t_fat``) in ``JOS3.dict_results()``. Their column names came from
  ``VINDEX`` while their values were taken as the first *n* entries of a full
  17-segment container, so ``t_muscle_pelvis`` carried the neck's value. Names and
  values are now selected with the same indices. Note ``t_superficial_vein`` remains
  mislabelled: it packs 12 limb values into the container's first 12 slots, and
  relabelling requires confirming the intended segment mapping.
* Fixed ``examples/calc_jos3.py`` setting ``model.icl``, which ``JOS3`` does not
  define. Clothing insulation is exposed as ``clo``, so the assignment created an
  unused attribute and the Stolwijk & Hardy validation ran at 0 clo, i.e. a nude
  subject, rather than the intended 0.3 clo pattern.
* The JOS-3 human-subject reference data ships as CSV instead of ``.xlsx``. Reading
  it previously required ``openpyxl``, which is not a dependency of this package, so
  ``validation_simulation()`` failed for anyone running the examples as documented.
  The values are unchanged; read them with
  ``pd.read_csv(..., float_precision="round_trip")``.
* Added ``examples/manuscript-v4/``, the reproducible scripts behind the figures in
  the *Building Simulation* manuscript describing this package, including a new
  JOS-3 transient example comparing simulated rectal and mean skin temperature
  against Stolwijk & Hardy (1966) human-subject data.
* Sped up ``two_nodes_gagge_sleep`` by compiling its stateful simulation loop
  with Numba while preserving its public output values and shapes. Empty
  ``tdb``/``tr``/``v``/``rh``/``clo``/``thickness_quilt`` inputs now raise a
  clear ``ValueError`` instead of failing with an unrelated ``TypeError``.
* Addressed Copilot review feedback on the 4.4.1 ``phs`` fix: pass ``param_name``
  explicitly to ``valid_range()`` for the ``(tr - tdb)`` check, and added regression
  tests for the applicability-limit and minute-1 skin-temperature behavior.
* Fixed the saturation vapour pressure calculation in ``utci``
  (`#372 <https://github.com/pythermalcomfort/pythermalcomfort/issues/372>`_): the
  Hardy/Wexler equation's ``ln(T)`` term used ``np.log1p`` (which computes
  ``ln(1 + T)``) instead of ``np.log``, inflating the saturation vapour pressure by
  ~1%. The resulting UTCI error is negligible in mild conditions (~0.03 °C at 25 °C,
  50% RH) but grows to ~0.7 °C at 40 °C, 80% RH, where UTCI matters most for heat
  stress assessment. Updated the affected hard-coded test expectations and added a
  regression test cross-checking ``utci``'s vapour pressure against ``p_sat``.

4.4.2 (2026-09-02)
------------------

* Pinned ``tests/conftest.py``'s ``validation-data-comfort-models`` fixture URL to the
  ``v1.0.0`` tag instead of ``main``, so upstream fixture changes can't silently affect
  CI before the pin is deliberately bumped and reviewed. See ``CONTRIBUTING.rst``'s
  "Keeping the validation-data-comfort-models pin current" section.

4.4.1 (2026-08-18)
------------------

* Fixed the ``phs`` applicability limits (`#225 <https://github.com/pythermalcomfort/pythermalcomfort/issues/225>`_):
    - the ``tr`` limit is now checked against ``ISO 7933 Annex A, Table A.1``'s actual
      ``0 < (tr - tdb) < 60`` range, instead of checking raw ``tr`` against ``(0, 60)``.
    - the metabolic rate limit is now standard-specific: ``100-450 W/m2`` (1.7-7.5 met)
      for the 2004 standard, ``56-250 W/m2`` (0.96-4.3 met) for the 2023 standard,
      instead of always using the 2004 range.
* Added the ISO 7933:2023 Annex E minute-1 skin temperature special case to the
  ``phs`` 2023 model (``t_sk`` is forced to its equilibrium value on the first
  minute), matching the standard's own reference program. This special case is
  not present in the 2004 edition.

4.4.0 (2026-07-25)
------------------

* Added ``ireq`` model to calculate Required Clothing Insulation (IREQ) and
  Duration Limited Exposure (DLE) based on ISO 11079.

4.3.0 (2026-07-24)
------------------

* Added ``SummaryPlot.set_categories()`` for summarizing an already-classified
  per-row category array — e.g. adaptive comfort's per-row acceptability
  bands, which can't be reduced to one continuous column plus fixed
  thresholds the way ``set_regions()`` handles PMV/UTCI-style outputs. See
  the ``set_categories()`` docstring for an ``np.select``-based recipe.

4.2.0 (2026-07-24)
------------------

* Added a ``pa`` (water vapour partial pressure) applicability check to
  ``pmv_ppd_iso``, per the ISO 7730 Clause 4 limit of 0 Pa to 2 700 Pa. Inputs
  outside this range (e.g. ``tdb=30``, ``rh=100`` gives ``pa`` ~4 243 Pa) now
  return ``nan`` instead of a value outside the standard's applicability.
* Fixed ``clo_dynamic_iso`` to estimate walking speed using the ISO 7730
  Annex C / ISO 9920 formula for undefined walking speed
  (``v_walk = 0.0052 * (met * 58.15 - 58)``, clipped to 0-0.7 m/s) instead of
  reusing ``v_relative``'s activity-generated-air-speed formula, which is a
  distinct formula intended for the whole-body PMV heat balance rather than
  the clothing dynamic insulation correction.
* Corrected the initial guess for clothing surface temperature in
  ``pmv_ppd_iso`` to match the corrected Annex D formula in ISO 7730:2025
  (``3.5 * (6.45 * icl + 0.1)``, missing the ``6.45 *`` factor present in the
  ISO 7730:2005 Annex D listing). This only affects the starting point of the
  iterative solver and does not change any output value.
* Added ``"7730-2025"`` as a supported ``model`` value for ``pmv_ppd_iso``
  and made it the default, since ISO 7730:2025 is now the current edition of
  the standard. ``"7730-2005"`` remains supported for backwards
  compatibility; both currently return identical results since the PMV/PPD
  formulae are unchanged between editions.

4.1.1 (2026-07-20)
------------------

* Sped up ``cooling_effect`` (~10x) by calling the already numba-jitted Gagge
  two-node kernel directly instead of the full ``set_tmp()`` public API on
  every root-finding iteration.
* Sped up ``solar_gain`` (~100x+) with numba: table-based interpolation and
  posture handling converted to JIT-compiled code.
* Pinned ``pillow>=10.3.0`` in docs requirements to resolve a transitive
  Snyk-flagged vulnerability.
* Reduced the ``build-test-publish-testPyPI.yml`` CI matrix to speed up
  TestPyPI release checks.

4.1.0 (2026-07-20)
------------------

* Added ``heat_index_schoen``, the Temperature-Humidity Index (THI) heat
  index model in accordance with Schoen (2005).
* Sped up ``heat_index_rothfusz``, ``heat_index_schoen``, and
  ``heat_index_lu`` with numba JIT compilation. ``heat_index_lu`` (an
  iterative root-solver) sees the largest gain, roughly 29x faster.

4.0.3 (2026-07-20)
------------------

* Added a ``Sports.CROQUET`` preset to ``sports_heat_stress_risk``
  (``clo=0.7, met=4.5, vr=0.5, duration=90``).
* Fixed the extreme-risk interpolation segment so it reaches a risk level of
  4.9 exactly 5 °C above the extreme threshold, instead of reaching it early
  at +4.5 °C and leaving the last 0.5 °C of the range dead.
* Fixed an inconsistency in ``sports_heat_stress_risk``'s extreme-risk
  interpolation: the upper anchor temperature used internally to scale the
  risk level was the raw, unrounded solver output, while the ``t_extreme``
  value returned to callers is rounded to one decimal. This could produce a
  risk level inconsistent with the documented/returned thresholds. The
  interpolation now uses the same rounded ``t_extreme`` that is returned.

4.0.2 (2026-06-23)
------------------

* Improved sports heat stress risk interpolation within the extreme range: the
  upper anchor temperature (where risk reaches 4.9) is now computed dynamically
  as ``t_extreme + 5 °C``. This makes the extreme-range scale consistent across
  humidity conditions — the risk always spans exactly 5 °C above the
  humidity-dependent extreme threshold regardless of ambient conditions.

4.0.1 (2026-06-17)
------------------

* Added Python 3.14 support. Removed ``pytest-travis-fold`` (unmaintained,
  incompatible with Python 3.14) and lifted the ``pytest<7`` cap.
* Fixed duplicate parametrize IDs in the ridge-regression test suite,
  which pytest 9 now rejects (``ast.Str`` was removed in Python 3.14).

4.0.0 (2026-06-16)
------------------

.. note::
    Version 4.0.0 introduces a new **Matplotlib plotting API** under
    ``pythermalcomfort.plots.matplotlib``. All four plot classes follow a
    fluent builder pattern — chain setter calls and finish with ``.plot()``
    to receive standard Matplotlib ``Figure`` / ``Axes`` handles for full
    customisation.

**New plotting module** (``pythermalcomfort.plots.matplotlib``)

* ``ThresholdPlot`` — shade comfort/stress regions on any two-axis chart
  (e.g. operative temperature vs. relative humidity, temperature vs. air
  speed). Configure regions via ``set_regions(thresholds, labels, colors)``.
* ``SummaryPlot`` — horizontal or vertical bar-summary chart built from a
  ``pandas.DataFrame``; useful for comparing multiple spaces or scenarios at
  a glance.
* ``AdaptivePlot`` — ready-made adaptive comfort chart for ASHRAE 55 and
  EN 16798, with configurable comfort bands.
* ``PsychrometricPlot`` — psychrometric chart with overlaid comfort regions.

All classes share a common ``BasePlot`` base and centralised visual defaults
(``_shared.py``), making it easy to apply a consistent house style.

**Other changes**

* Refactored type hints across model function signatures to use a
  ``NumericInput`` alias (``float | int | np.floating | np.integer``),
  improving IDE auto-complete and static-analysis accuracy.
* Added ``hr_to_rh`` utility for humidity-ratio → relative-humidity
  conversion.
* Minor cooling-effect calculation streamlining and constant centralisation.

3.9.8 (2026-05-25)
------------------

* Added optional ``round_output`` parameter to ``adaptive_ashrae`` and ``adaptive_en``
  to control rounding of output values.
* Added ``limit_inputs`` parameter to ``ankle_draft`` and ``vertical_tmp_grad_ppd``,
  consistent with other model functions.
* ``ankle_draft`` and ``vertical_tmp_grad_ppd`` now raise ``UserWarning`` when inputs
  exceed model applicability limits.
* Fixed ``compliance`` attribute being included in non-ASHRAE PMV model outputs;
  it is now only returned by ``pmv_ppd_ashrae``.
* Fixed UTCI stress category mapping when ``units="IP"``; categories were
  incorrectly mapped before IP unit conversion.

3.9.3 (2026-05-01)
------------------

* Maintenance release: internal CI pipeline improvements and dependency updates.
  No user-facing changes.

3.9.2 (2026-04-14)

    breaking change for the `phs` function:
    - the `phs` function now returns all the outputs needed to use the outputs of a previous calculation as inputs for a new calculation.
    - removed outputs: ``water_loss``, ``water_loss_watt``
    - added outputs (with units):

        * ``sweat_loss_g`` [g] — cumulative sweat mass per person (not area‑normalised)
        * ``sweat_rate_watt`` [W·m⁻²] — instantaneous evaporative heat flux at skin
        * ``evap_load_wm2_min`` [W·min·m⁻²] — accumulated evaporative load for chaining

    Migration:

    .. code-block:: python

        # <= 3.5.x
        grams = res.water_loss
        w_m2 = res.water_loss_watt
        # >= 3.6.0
        grams = res.sweat_loss_g

3.0.0 (2025-02-03)
-------------------

.. warning::
    pythermalcomfort version 3.0.0 introduces some breaking changes.

    **How functions return results:**
    as the functions now return dataclass instances with the calculation results.
    This change enhances the structure and accessibility of the results.
    For example:

    .. code-block:: python

        from pythermalcomfort.models import pmv_ppd_iso

        result = pmv_ppd_iso(
            tdb=[22, 25], tr=25, vr=0.1, rh=50, met=1.4, clo=0.5, model="7730-2005"
        )
        print(result.pmv)  # [-0.  0.41]

    This update aims to make the package more user-friendly and to provide a more organized way to access all calculation results.

    **Moved functions**
    Moved all the functions that were in the `psychrometrics.py` file to the `utilities.py` file.

    **Changed function names**
    All the PMV functions have been renamed using the following format: `pmv_XXX` where XXX is the standard or the model name.

    **PMV function**
    The pmv_ppd function now has been split into two functions: pmv_ppd_iso and pmv_ppd_ashrae.

.. note::
    We have updated all functions to accept Numpy arrays as inputs, allowing you to pass multiple values at once for faster results.
    Single values are still accepted, and the functions will return results as before.
    Additionally, we have synchronized the tests with the R comf package to ensure consistent calculation results across both packages.

    Other improvements include:

    * Enhanced documentation with more examples.
    * Better described the models.
    * Added more tests to ensure calculation accuracy.
    * Implemented input validation to ensure inputs are within model applicability limits.
    * Harmonized input names across all functions.
    * Added surveys to assess thermal comfort to the documentation.
    * Added a detailed section about clothing insulation.

-------------------

.. warning::
    Version 2.0.0 introduces some breaking changes. Now the default behaviour of most of the function is that they return a ``np.nan`` if the inputs are outside the model applicability limits.

    For most functions we are no longer printing ``Warnings``. If you want the function to return a value even if your inputs are outside the model applicability limits then you can set the variable ``limit_input = False``. Please note that you should refrain from doing this.


.. note::
    Starting from Version 2.0.0 of pythermalcomfort now most of the functions (see detailed list below) accept Numpy arrays or lists as inputs. This allows you to write more concise and faster code since we optimized vectorization, where possible using Numba.
